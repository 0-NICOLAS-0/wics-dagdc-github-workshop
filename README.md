# Git/GitHub Workshop - README Overview

## ‚òòÔ∏è About README.md files

### üí´ A README.md file is a text file that describes the project contained in a repo.
- _.md_ = a "markdown" text file -> allows special formatting and some html/css capabilities.
- Resides at the root directory of the project (not inside any folders!)
- Helps the audience understand how to install and use your project
- **Good practice**: make it the first file you create in a new project!

### üí´ It contains information, such as:
- Description & purpose of project
- Technologies used in the project
- List of key features
- How to download / run / use project
- File structure
- How to collaborate with you (if applicable)
- License information (if any)

And more!

`Code block` with 3 backticks (```) before and after a block of text, on its own lines. Can also add code language to color text.
```` python
``` python
print('hi')
```
````

### ‚ú® Lists
- Bulleted list with dash (-) or asterisk (*) followed by space, then text: `- text here` or `* text here`

- [DAGDC Linktree](http://linktr.ee/DAGAMEDEV)

### ‚ú® Images
<img width="1159" height="286" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/437fa586-89f1-4992-ae82-28ad85aee313" />

**2 ways to add an image**: standard markdown and raw html.
- Standard markdown: `![Image alt text here](image link here)`
   - Simpler & more readable.
   - Keeps original size, and offers limited control.
- Raw HTML: `<img alt="alt text" src="image link" width="..." height="..." align="..."/>`
   - Everything other than src is optional.
   - Provides more control over display details, like size & alignment, but sacrifices readability.

### ‚ú® Horizontal Rule
Add a horizontal rule (a.k.a. divider) by using 3 dashes with a blank line before and after: 
```
Section 1

---

Section 2
```

Divider pictured below:
